For Multiple subject tracking scenario 2, the tracking video using the contour method could not be uploaded in moodle because the total file size allowed is 500mb. So i have uploaded that video in google drive and i have shared it with you. This is the link:

Do note that all of the other videos are included in the original file submitted to moodle.

Also i used the YOLO object detector for tracking which has some configuration files like the weights of the pretrained neural network. I couldn't also include those in the original file because of the file size restrictions. So i have uploaded those files in google drive and shared with you. This is the link:
